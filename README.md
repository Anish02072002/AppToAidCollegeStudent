# AppToAidCollegeStudent
An app that handles all of the challenges that college students experience, such as obtaining an internship or employment, 
balancing their life and education, negotiating student loan debt, organizing their assignments, establishing deadlines, 
and keeping track of their grades. Itâ€™s one of the most creative hackathon problem statements for beginners.

- # Idea and Approach
- 1.) The idea is to create two apps that share a single database. 
2.) An Admin App, accessible by professors and job posters, will allow them to post jobs and research topics for college students to apply.  It will also show the students who applied for certain project and Faculty or Employer can Shoertlist them
3.) A Student App will be divided into 4 parts
Firstly  Student will be able to see recent job or research posted by Faculty or potential Employer.
Student will be able apply from there by providing relevant Information
Secondly Student will be able to compare different student Loans provided by different banks and will be able to choose the policy which suits them the best.
Thirdly It will be consist of a portal where student can post problem or thing they need which will be shown to every person using the app. If anybody will be capable of help they might contact the person. Example if a student urgently needs Paracetamol tablet they can post there request
Fourthly it consists of  Task Managment Portal where students can upload and manage task which will use Eisenhower Matrix to help them arrange task so that they do not waste time on any unnecessary task and can maintain healthy work Life balance. 
Since we forget easily, by uploading task here you can always access it and complete every project on time
